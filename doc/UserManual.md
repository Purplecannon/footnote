# User Manual

## A high-level description

Footnote is a tool designed to help dancers and choreographers digitally notate, visualize, and
share their routines with ease. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned dancer, Footnote makes it
easy to organize and document choreography in a much more efficient way than traditional methods.
Footnote's key feature allows a user to leave detailed notes on specific timestamps in their dance
video.

## How to install the software

You need an internet connection and a web browser, Chrome is recommended. There are no further system prerequisites to use Footnote.

## How to run the software

Navigate to <https://footnote.us/> to use Footnote.

## How to use the software

The initial page will be a login page where you can enter your username and password if you have an account with Footnote already. If it is your first time using Footnote, you can click the 'Click here!' to create an account. This will direct you to a page where you can create a username and a password and confirm your password.

After successfully logging in to your account or signing up for an account, you will be directed to the projects home page. Here, you will be able to see all the different projects you have previously made displayed in a board view. If a previously made project is clicked on, it will open the project page for that project. You will also have the plus button to create a new project. If the create new project button is clicked, you will be directed to a blank project page.

The project page has two main sections.

1. The left side includes the video section. You can upload a new video by clicking on the pencil icon. If a project already has a video uploaded, that video should display. The video comes with controls like the play/pause button, scrubber to move the current time in the video, different playback speeds, full screen, and mute audio.
2. The right side includes a list of all of the previously made annotations and the annotation functions. You can create a new annotation by pausing the video/scrubbing the video to a timestamp of your choice, then filling in the annotation text box as desired. There are also the edit and delete annotation buttons to the right of each annotation. Clicking on the timestamp associated with each annotation will take the video to that timestamp.
3. You can click on the Home button to go back to the projects home screen, the Delete button to delete this project, or the Logout button to logout.

## How to report a bug

Internally, we will be using the [Issues](https://github.com/miahuynhh/footnote/issues) tab in our Github repository. This allows us to keep track of bugs being reported and address them right away. We can even tag people who have worked on that portion of the code. After the bug has been addressed, the issue will be closed. However, we will still have a history of bugs which helps us keep track of “known bugs” and allows us to better fix bugs that may arise in the future.

As for bug reporting, we will be following some of the tips mentioned in the bug writing guidelines from Mozilla

1.  First, please describe the expected behavior (how our website should work) and the actual behavior.

2.  Indicate whether you can reproduce the bug, and if so, please outline the steps you will take.

    a. Additionally, anyone who reports a bug should copy and paste the error that they are getting in the issue description. This allows people to get a bigger picture of the error and makes it easier for developers to look for solutions on their own.

    b. It would be good to note whether this occurs every time or if it is an intermittent issue.

3.  You should also indicate any steps that you have already taken, so that other developers know what to rule out.

4.  Other information to include would be type of device, operating system, and browser.

After reporting the bug, it’s important to follow up so that this is addressed in a timely manner.

## Known bugs

We will be documenting our “known bugs” in our [BugReport.md](./BugReport.md) tab. This will include common bugs and their behavior as well as the exact steps to fix the bug.
