# Developer Guidelines

## How to obtain the source code
The source code of footnote can be found in its public [gitHub repository](https://github.com/miahuynhh/footnote).

## The layout of Footnote's directory structure

## How to build the software
First, clone the remote repository by running this command on the command line:
`git clone git@github.com:miahuynhh/footnote.git`
You should now see a local `footnote` directory. From that root `footnote` directory, run the following commands:
`npm run install-all`  # to install all dependencies in the `footnote`, `footnote-backend`, and `footnote-frontend` folders
`npm run build`        # to build the frontend; this command is commonly used for deployment, can skip this command during development
`npm start`            # to start the backend server (on port 3000) and the frontend app (on port 5173) concurrently

## How to test the software

## How to add new tests

## How to build a release of the software
Run an appropriate command from the following to update the version:
`npm run version:patch`  # for a patch update
`npm run version:minor`  # for a minor update
`npm run version:major`  # for a major update
These commands increments the version in `package.json`, commit the change, and tag the commit with the new version.

Perform sanity checks on the version update:
`npm run build`  # to build the frontend to ensure itâ€™s ready for deployment
`npm test`       # to run the test suite to confirm all tests pass
`npm start`      # to start the backend server (port 3000) and frontend app (port 5173) concurrently to verify they function together as expected
Also ensure that the git tag generated by the versioning command matches the intended version.

After reviewing the version update, push it to the remote repository:
`git push`         # push the version update
`git push --tags`  # push the version update tag
