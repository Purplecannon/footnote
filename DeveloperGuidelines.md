# Developer Guidelines

## How to obtain the source code

The source code of footnote can be found in its public [gitHub repository](https://github.com/miahuynhh/footnote).

## The layout of Footnote's directory structure

### frontend

```
footnote-frontend
├── public # Reusable actions, e.g., navigating, opening, creating entities
├── pages # Website pages
├── components # Reusable React components across scenes
├── hooks # Reusable React hooks
└── routes # Route definitions
```

### backend

```
footnote-backend
├── routes # All API routes
│ ├── api # API endpoints
│ └── auth # Authentication routes
├── config # Database configuration
├── services # Services (e.g., S3)
└── test # Test helpers
```

## How to build the software

First, clone the remote repository by running this command on the command line:
`git clone git@github.com:miahuynhh/footnote.git`
You should now see a local `footnote` directory. From that root `footnote` directory, run the following commands:
`npm run install-all` # to install all dependencies in the `footnote`, `footnote-backend`, and `footnote-frontend` folders
`npm run build` # to build the frontend; this command is commonly used for deployment, can skip this command during development
`npm start` # to start the backend server (on port 3000) and the frontend app (on port 5173) concurrently

## How to test the software

Ensure that all necessary packages are installed - i.e. run `npm install-all` from the root directory.
For backend testing, ensure that the proper database configurations are in place - the correct .env file in the root directory, and the ca-certificate.crt file in the config directory in the footnote-backend directory.
For backend testing - navigate to the footnote-backend directory.
For frontend testing - navigate to the footnote-frontend directory.
Ensure that the `test` folder is present within the directory, then run the following from the terminal:

```
npm test
```

## How to add new tests

Navigate to the `test` directory - either in footnote-backend or footnote-frontend - and write tests using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and the default node `assert` library, either by adding to an existing file with the `.mjs` extension, or by creating a new one. For a new file, import the assertion library:

```
import * as assert from 'assert';
```

## How to build a release of the software

Run an appropriate command from the following to update the version:
`npm run version:patch` # for a patch update
`npm run version:minor` # for a minor update
`npm run version:major` # for a major update
These commands increments the version in `package.json`, commit the change, and tag the commit with the new version.

Perform sanity checks on the version update:
`npm run build` # to build the frontend to ensure it’s ready for deployment
`npm test` # to run the test suite to confirm all tests pass
`npm start` # to start the backend server (port 3000) and frontend app (port 5173) concurrently to verify they function together as expected
Also ensure that the git tag generated by the versioning command matches the intended version.

After reviewing the version update, push it to the remote repository:
`git push` # push the version update
`git push --tags` # push the version update tag
