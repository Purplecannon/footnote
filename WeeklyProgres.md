## Week 3

## Assignment:

Software Architecture Update.

#### Alicia Z.

- Team decided to switch to javascript for backend. So, I deleted all spring stuff and generated express js.
- Implemented video uploading logic in the backend and tested successfully with postman.
- Wrote software architecture for software architecture. Shared with team and asked for their feedback.

## Week 4

## Assignment:

Software Design, Risk Assessment, Schedule update.

#### Alicia Z.

- Wrote two risk cases for the assignment and also personal schedule.
- Revised software architecture and software design based on my own understanding, shared with team and asked for their feedback.
- Moved to front-end, started to learn react.
- Generated vite for front-end framework and moved Kirupa's code there.
- Cleaned up git main branch. Because at that time most of the team members are pushing to main, leading to 70+ commits on main branch, and lots of unnecessary files, such as the leftover stuff from spring and node_modules.
- Started to implement user homepage. Halfway done: logic set up but lack styling.
