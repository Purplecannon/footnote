# Overview

Footnote is a web application designed to support dancers and choreographers in creating, visualizing, and sharing choreographic routines. Through its advanced features, Footnote enables users to make timed notations on dance videos, synchronize movements with music, visualize routines through audio waveforms, map formations, and export or share choreography seamlessly. By transforming traditional methods—such as memorization, paper notes, or basic recordings—into a streamlined digital experience, Footnote fosters a collaborative environment that redefines how dance routines are crafted, documented, and communicated.
