# Overview

Footnote is a web application designed to support dancers and choreographers in creating, visualizing, and sharing choreographic routines. Through its features, Footnote enables users to make timed notations on dance videos and share choreography notes seamlessly. By transforming traditional methods — such as memorization, paper notes, or basic recordings — into a streamlined digital experience, Footnote fosters a collaborative environment that redefines how dance routines are crafted, documented, and communicated.
