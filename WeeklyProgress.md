## Week 4

## Assignment:

Software Design, Risk Assessment, Schedule update.

#### Kirupa Gunaseelan

#### Mia Huynh

- Set up database configurations for DigitalOcean Cluster
- Connected the database in database.js
- Implemented createTables(), clearTables(), userCreate(), userLogin() in users.js
- Set up and initialized all USERS, PROJECTS, and ANNOTATIONS tables in app.js

#### Catherine Jin

- Write unit tests for creating an account and logging in
- (won't run the unit tests until those functions are complete and a delete account function is implemented so we can remove any dummy accounts added during unit testing)
- Set up testing branch
- Started researching Javascript-specific testing frameworks

#### Elainie Kassa

#### Lauren Yarrington

- Implemented createAnnotation() that takes project ID and timestamp
- Implemented editAnnotation() that takes project ID and timestamp
- Implemented saveAnnotation() that takes project ID, note, and timestamp
- Implemented deleteAnnotation() that takes project ID and timestamp

#### Alicia Z.

- Wrote two risk cases for the assignment and also personal schedule.
- Revised software architecture and software design based on my own understanding, shared with team and asked for their feedback.
- Moved to front-end, started to learn react.
- Generated vite for front-end framework and moved Kirupa's code there.
- Cleaned up git main branch. Because at that time most of the team members are pushing to main, leading to 70+ commits on main branch, and lots of unnecessary files, such as the leftover stuff from spring and node_modules.
- Started to implement user homepage. Halfway done: logic set up but lack styling.
